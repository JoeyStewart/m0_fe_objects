# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

The hardest part of the challenges was trying to print out the object variables within objects.js. I kept trying to use line of code like Object.keys(foods);, since that is what I saw in the lesson. Though I could not print the line of code this way. I needed to use console.log(Object.keys(foods));. This worked but I'm not sure if this should be the standard way moving forward. It is a question I will have to consult my group with. Overall I did enjoy every challenge. Nothing felt out of reach for me. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I've had a very smooth time with time management. I haven't felt over burdened and no challenge has taken me too long. I do incorporate breaks now even if I don't feel like I initally need them when working. I have found that taking breaks really help with problem solving.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

I want to remember the usefulness and differences between Arrays and Objects so I can use them most effectively. Some similar terminology will need to be worked on aswell. Object literals and objects are two different tools that I initially did not realize.
